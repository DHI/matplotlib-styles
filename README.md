Matplotlib Styles for DHI Office Report Template

Many figures in reports are generated by Matplotlib in Python these days.

These Matplotlib styles make sure that the figures have a consistent layout and fit nicely into the DHI Report templates. They allow to set the most important properties of a figure (tight layout, width=15 cm, axis and label font fitting to DHI body text) with a one-liner, e.g. `plt.style.use("DHI")`.

To install, simply copy the files to `C:\users\<yourName>\.matplotlib\stylelib` (create the folder if missing).
